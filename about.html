<h2 align="center">About Us</h2>
<p>Hello! We are Grace and Carli, and welcome to our page, "Eat It!", where we document all the foods we have eaten and all the places we have eaten at while traveling! We want to make it easier for you on your trips and lead you to the best tasting cuisine around. We are both students attending the University of St Andrews, and we hope you get a chance to visit Scotland as well as all the other countries we have posted about!</p>
